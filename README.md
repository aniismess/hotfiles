# My Dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, I've poured countless hours into this setup, and now I'm sharing it with the world. Don't even try asking me if something goes wrong

## What's Inside This Digital Treasure Chest?

This repo is a veritable cornucopia of configurations for all your favorite command-line tools:

- **i3:** The window manager for people who think GUIs are for casuals. My i3 setup is so minimal, it makes a Zen garden look cluttered.
- **Fish:** The shell that's so good, it'll make you want to slap your mama. Or at least, it'll make you forget that Bash ever existed.
- **Neovim:** The one true editor. I've customized it with so much Lua, it's practically a new application. It's fast, it's beautiful, and it's probably smarter than you are.
- **Kitty:** The terminal emulator that's faster than a cat on a hot tin roof. It's so good, it'll make you want to live in your terminal.
- **Picom:** The compositor that adds just the right amount of eye candy. It's like putting a little bit of lipstick on a pig, but in a good way.
- **Fastfetch:** Because who doesn't want to show off their sick Arch Linux setup? It's like a digital peacock.
- **Obsidian:** My second brain. It's where I keep all my brilliant ideas, my half-baked schemes, and my grocery lists.

Each of these directories has its own `README.md` file,make sure to check them out where I'll try to explain my genius-level configurations in a way that even a mere mortal can understand.

## Prerequisites

Before running the installation script, ensure you have the following installed on your Arch Linux system:

- **Git**: For cloning this repository.
- **Sudo**: For elevated privileges during package installation.
- **An AUR Helper**: Either `yay` or `paru` is required for automatic dependency installation.

If you need to install these, you can typically do so with:

```bash
sudo pacman -S git
# For yay (example):
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/yay.git
cd yay
makepkg -si
# For paru (example):
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/paru.git
cd paru
makepkg -si
```

## Dependencies

These dotfiles rely on several packages. The `install.sh` script will attempt to install these automatically using your detected AUR helper (`yay` or `paru`). If you prefer to install them manually, here's a list of the common dependencies:

```bash
yay -S ttf-jetbrains-mono-nerd dunst polybar nitrogen networkmanager-applet rofi fish neovim kitty picom fastfetch i3-gaps obsidian
```

## Installation

To install these dotfiles, navigate to the root of this repository and run the `install.sh` script:

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will present you with a menu to choose which dotfiles you'd like to install. It will also attempt to install necessary packages using `yay` or `paru` if available on your system. Feel free to modify these dotfiles to suit your personal preferences and workflow after installation!

## My Guiding Philosophy (or lack thereof)

I'm not gonna lie, I'm mostly just making this up as I go along. But if I had to put a label on it, I'd say my philosophy is something like this:

- **Speed is key:** I want my computer to be faster than my brain, which isn't saying much, but still.
- **Keyboards are for typing, not for mousing:** If I have to touch a mouse, I've already lost.
- **Looks matter:** I'm not a monster. I want my workspace to be as beautiful as it is functional.
- **It's my party, and I'll cry if I want to:** These dotfiles are for me, first and foremost. But if you like them, that's cool too.

## You Want to Contribute? Seriously?

If you've got a suggestion that's so good it'll make me question my own sanity, then by all means, open an issue or a pull request. But be warned, I'm a harsh critic. I'm also happy to answer any questions you might have, as long as they're not dumb.

## License

These dotfiles are released under the MIT License. That means you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sue me. See the `LICENSE` file for the boring legal stuff.
